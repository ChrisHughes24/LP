abstract="We present an Isabelle/HOL formalization and total correctness proof for the incremental version of the Simplex algorithm which is used in most state-of-the-art SMT solvers. Formalization relies on stepwise program and data refinement, starting from a simple specification, going through a number of fine refinement steps, and ending up in a fully executable functional implementation. Symmetries present in the algorithm are handled with special care.",
